During the first half of the 20th century, many experimental 
discoveries were challenging particle physicists to find a 
coherent model to explain the existence of new particles and 
forces. A ``heavy electron'', the muon, was observed in 1936 
by C.%arl 
 Anderson and S.%eth 
 Neddermeyer in cosmic radiation, and later
observed in a cloud chamber experiment by %Jabez Curry 
J.C. Street and E. C. Stevenson~\cite{PhysRev.52.1003}. 
The neutrino, postulated in 1930 by %Wolfgang
W. Pauli\footnote{Pauli did not write a scientific
paper of his great intuition, which is only testified 
by a letter he sent to the 1930 Gauverein meeting in T\"ubingen,
famous also for his funny opening 
``{\it Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen,[\dots]}''. A copy
of the letter can be found in \url{http://tinyurl.com/cjgoubj}, 
and a nice history of the neutrino is in~\cite{2006physics...3106P}.}
to explain the shape of the electron 
spectrum in beta decay, was experimentally 
detected in 1956 by %Clyde L. 
C.L. Cowan and %Frederick 
F. Reines~\cite{1956Sci...124..103C}, and few years later a 
second neutrino type was discovered by %Leon M. 
L.M. Lederman, %Melvin 
M. Schwartz and %Jack 
J. Steinberger~\cite{1962PhRvL...9...36D}. 
By 1963 a huge number of new {\it mesons} and {\it baryons} 
were populating what was called the ``particle zoo'' 
until Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig independently proposed 
a classification for all these new particles 
supposing that hadrons were made by three smaller 
components~\cite{GellMann1964214,Zweig:352337} dotated of a new
quantum number, the hypercharge $Y=2(Q-I_3)$, where $Q$ is the electric
charge and $I_3$ the third componend of the isospin.
Figure~\ref{fig:eightfold} shows this particle classification referred to as 
``the eightfold way''\footnote{See e.g. \url{http://lccn.loc.gov/65013009}.}.

          by Yuval Ne'eman) identifies three fundamental components (a) 
          and classifies through their electric charge $q$ and strangeness $s$:
          a spin-0 meson octet (b), a spin-1 meson octet (c), 
          a spin-1/2 baryon octet (d) and a spin-3/2 baryon decuplet (e).
          It is now understood that this structure is a 
          consequence of flavour symmetry.\label{fig:eightfold}}
\end{center}\end{figure}

It was the beginning of the {\it quark model}, a theory that had to 
wait for multiple experimental evidence before being accepted,
nevertheless it successfully predicted a new particle, the strangeness $s$=-3 
particle $\Omega^{-}$ of the spin-3/2 baryon decuplet of Figure~\ref{fig:eightfold},
discovered in 1964 at Brookhaven~\cite{PhysRevLett.12.204}. 
Even when in 1968 deep inelastic experiments at the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) found out evidence for a 
substructure in protons~\cite{PhysRevLett.23.930,PhysRevLett.23.935}, physicists were reluctant to accept 
this point-like objects to be the quarks. Richard Feynman called 
them \textit{partons}, the term now used to identify quarks 
and antiquarks as well as gluons.

However, back then there was a tougher problem tormenting theoretical physicists. 
Quantum field theory was in fact apparently unsuitable for the description 
of the dynamics of particles interactions, since divergences appeared in the 
high energy domain. In 1954 Chen N. Yang and Robert Mills proposed a new gauge 
theory~\cite{PhysRev.96.191} based on the principle of {\it local gauge invariance},
i.e. the property of space-time regions of not being affected 
by a symmetry transformation performed 
locally in a different region. With the addition of a scalar 
field proposed by Peter Higgs, 
Fran\c{c}ois Englert and Robert 
Brout~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.321,PhysRevLett.13.508} and the implied 
modification of the vacuum structure, the Yang-Mills field 
became a very accurate description of the weak force interactions. 
Such unified model was consistently proposed, independently, in the 1960s 
by Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven 
Weinberg~\cite{Glashow1961579,PhysRevLett.19.1264}, 
but it suffered of a problem: 
as it was a perturbative theory, equations 
had to be expanded in a power series to be calculated but only the leading order 
term did not show ultraviolet divergences\footnote{Divergences in computations
are classified according to the energy scale at which they appear. Following
the Planck relation $E=h\nu$ and the relation between the wave lenght and
the frequency of radiation $\lambda\nu = c$, in natural units 
($\hbar=c=1$) energies of the order of 1~\tev\ 
or more lie in the ultraviolet (UV) range: $\lambda({\rm UV})\sim 10^{-9}$~m.
Divergencies appearing at the energy scale of 1~\gev\ or less are in the 
infrared (IR) range: $\lambda({\rm IR})\sim 10^{-6}$~m.}.

By the first years of the 1970s Gerard't Hooft demonstrated in his
PhD thesis under the supervision of  Martinus Veltman the
renormalization for the theory~\cite{tHooft1971173,Hooft1971167}, 
with the result that divergences could be 
cancelled and physical observables obtained with precisions higher than the 
leading order. 
The concept of \textit{renormalization group} was introduced and 
Yang-Mills theories were found to have a $\beta$-function (a function 
typical of gauge theories) generally negative. This was the discovery 
of \textit{asymptotic freedom}, a property that made Yang-Mills theory 
suitable also to describe strong interactions and that matched properly 
with the experimental effect named \textit{Bjorken scaling}\footnote{At 
SLAC it was observed during deep inelastic scattering experiments that 
strong interactions show a decrease of strenght at short distances (i.e. 
high momentum transfer) together with a scaling behaviour. A property is 
said to ``scale'' when it depends only by dimensionless kinematic quantities, 
such as a scattering angle or the ratio of the energy to a momentum transfer.}. 

At the same time, the three-quark model by Gell-Mann and Zweig was about to 
be expanded. In 1963 Nicola Cabibbo proposed the mixing of up, down and 
strange quark~\cite{PhysRevLett.10.531} 
in order to explain the non-conservation of quark flavour 
in weak interactions as $\Lambda \rightarrow p^{+}\pi^{-}$ with $\Delta S$=1 
and the empirical law $\Delta S = \Delta Q$ for strangeness changing processes. 
In 1970 Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiani (GIM) predicted a fourth quark~\cite{PhysRevD.2.1285}, 
the charm, to account for the non-observation of Strangeness Changing Neutral 
Current (SCNC) processes. Thus, the quark mixing between the two families
of quarks ($u$, $d$) and ($c$, $s$) could be described with a $2\times 2$ 
matrix, parameterized by the Cabibbo angle $\theta_{C}$ and referred to as
 the Cabibbo-GIM matrix:
\begin{equation}\label{CabibboGIM}
V_{c} = {\setlength\arraycolsep{6pt}
\left( \begin{array}{cc}
\cos\theta_{C} & \sin\theta_{C}\\
-\sin\theta_{C}& \cos\theta_{C}
\end{array}
\right)} \quad .
\end{equation}
Furthermore, after the observation of events violating the Charge-Parity (CP) 
symmetry~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.286}, Makoto Kobayashi and 
Toshihide Maskawa supposed the 
existence of two more quarks, the bottom and the top, thus increasing 
the number of quark flavours to six~\cite{Kobayashi:1973fv}. 
This allowed the introduction in 
the extended $3\times 3$ mixing matrix (the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa CKM matrix) 
of, besides three angles, a complex phase that is responsible of CP violation. 
All this conjectures found an important confirmation in November 1974, a date
later known as ``the November Revolution'' probably because it set the 
beginning of a real trust in the quark theory. 
Almost simultaneously at SLAC and at Brookhaven the charm quark was discovered 
in the bound state $c\bar c$, called $J$ meson by the Brookhaven team and 
$\psi$ by the SLAC one, so that in the end it was named $J/\psi$~\cite{PhysRevLett.33.1404,PhysRevLett.33.1406}. 
Not too much later, the bottom quark was observed in 1977 at 
Fermilab~\cite{PhysRevLett.39.252}, 
enhancing the belief in the top quark existence and in the six flavours theory.

The discovery of the tau lepton in 1975~\cite{PhysRevLett.35.1489} and of the 
$W$ and $Z$ bosons in 1983~\cite{Arnison1983103,Banner1983476,} finally set the scene for 
the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Table~\ref{tab:SM} 
shows the fundamental particles composing the SM: three generations of 
fermions, each of them having a corresponding 
antiparticle, the three forces (three Yang-Mills fields) with 
their vector bosons, and the Higgs boson whose field interaction with
particles results in the lagrangian mass terms. A great achievement of the SM was 
the unification of electromagnetic and weak theories in the Electroweak 
Theory by Salam, Glashow and Weinberg. In fact, since at a scale of about 
100~GeV the coupling constants converge, it is possible to describe them 
within the same mathematical model. Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) instead 
describes the strong interaction in terms of the color threefold charge 
and up to now is not known if also the strong coupling constant can become 
equal to the others at some high energy scale. However, a unified theory is 
strongly desired, as will be stressed in Section~\ref{sec:THquest}.

Even if the SM was somehow born to be merely a stepping stone, 
it consolidated through years, standing all experimental tests 
sometimes with a precision greater than 0.1\%. Experiments carried 
out at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, 
thanks to the clean signals given by $e^{+}e^{-}$ collision events, 
allowed to obtain very high precision measurements of the SM parameters
(see Figure~\ref{fig:smparam} for a summary of the measurements, with
their errors, of the free parameters of the SM).

%\url{http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29076}}
\end{center}\end{figure}
 
In particular experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL performed the measurements 
of the $Z$ boson mass with a precision of 0.0023\% that made it one of the most 
precisely known quantities within the SM. %AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA \footnote{Note that the masses of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are not predicted by the theory, but their ratio is (see Section~\ref{sec:ewlagr}).}. 
Furthermore, measurements of its total 
decay width and of its partial decay widths for all processes with a 
visible final state (i.e. different from $\nu\bar\nu$) allowed to set 
the number of light neutrino flavours to three, confirming the three-generation 
SM and excluding the possibility for a fourth family of leptons with masses
 lower than half of $m_Z$.

The penultimate discovery inside the SM has been the observation of the 
top quark in 1995 at the Fermilab's experiments CDF and 
D0~\cite{PhysRevLett.74.2626,PhysRevLett.74.2422}. 
The mass of the top quark resulted consistent with the predicted 
constraints, thus confirming again the SM as an accurate framework. 
At that point, and for almost 20 years, the last missing piece whose
absence could invalidate all the previous beautiful corroborations, was
the observation of a Higgs boson with a light mass for  self-consistency 
of the overall fit of data. When the LEP physics program was terminated,
direct searches gave, at 95\% CL, a lower limit of 114~\gev\ and an upper 
limit of 144~\gev\ on the mass of the Higgs boson~\cite{Renton}.

Then LEP was dismantled, the LHC was built, and in 2012 
the ATLAS and CMS experiments
observed a new $\sim$125~\gev\ mass boson~\cite{2012gk,Chatrchyan201230}
with the same spin-parity as the one expected from a Standard Model
Higgs boson. A precise {\it identikit} of this new particles, necessary
in order to say the final word about its nature (is it a Higgs boson?
Is it the Standard Model Higgs boson? Is it a ``new physics'' Higgs boson?),
is expected to come within the next decades of activity of the LHC and its
experiments.


\subsection{Building the Standard Model}\label{sec:THsm}

The Standard Model (SM) is a gauge theory invariant under the symmetry 
transformation $SU(3)_{C} \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$. The
three terms of the product of groups are the matrix representations
of the fundamental symmetries acting on the forces of Nature ({\it quantum fields})
governing the interactions of particles: 
$SU(3)_{C}$ is the {\it color} unbroken 
symmetry %containing the color triplets %, described by Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) 
 acting on the gluon field $G_a$; 
$SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ is the unified {\it electroweak} broken 
symmetry, %described by Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED), 
with the weak symmetry $SU(2)_{L}$
%containing the left-handed weak isospin doublets 
acting on the vector boson fields $W_{1,2,3}$ and on the scalar Higgs field $\phi$,
and the electromagnetic symmetry $U(1)_{Y}$ %containing the right-handed isospin singlets.
acting on the vector boson field $B$ and on the scalar Higgs field $\phi$.

The quantum number $C$, the color charge, is carried only by
quarks, antiquarks and gluons 
in three different values labelled ``red'', ``gree'', ``blue''.
The quantum number $I$, the weak isospin, differentiates between left-handed
($I=1/2$) and right-handed ($I=0$) fermions, with the latter not undergoing weak interactions.
 %The quantum number $L$, the flavor charge, is carried by fermions as
 %{\it lepton number} for leptons and as {\it baryon number} for quarks.
The quantum number $Y$, the hypercharge, is defined as $Y=2(Q-I_3)$, 
where $Q$ is the electric charge and $I_3$ the third componend of the isospin,
which is $I_3=+1/2$ for up-type quarks and negatively charged leptons, and
 $I_3=-1/2$ for down-type quarks and neutrinos (and {\it vice-versa} for the antiparticles).

%These quantum numbers are the generators for the

Gravity is not (yet) included in the model, and even though
this is a flaw of the SM that is desirable to be fixed in a 
Grand Unified Theory (GUT), its action on particles is of many order
of magnitudes lower than the others' and is, therefore, negligible at the
fundamental components scale.


\subsubsection{Building the electroweak lagrangian}\label{sec:ewlagr}

The Lagrangian of the SM is built by {\it gauging} the symmetries in 
order to obtain invariance under those transformations.
Fermions are spin-1/2 particles that can be represented as spinors.
Using $\psi_{L}$ and 
$\psi_{R}$ to denote the left-handed and right-handed fermion fields 
respectively, 
the bare electroweak Lagrangian of the SM (considering 
for simplicity only leptons) is made of two terms:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bareLagSM}
\mathcal{L}_{0} = \mathcal{L}_{lept}+ \mathcal{L}_{gauge}
\end{equation}
that are 
\begin{align}
&\left \{ \begin{array}{cl}
\mathcal{L}_{lept} &=\;\;  \bar\psi_{L}i\slashed{D}_{L}\psi_{L} + \bar\psi_{R}i\slashed{D}_{R}\psi_{R}\\
D_{L}^{\mu} &=\;\;  \partial^{\mu} + ig\dfrac{\bar{\sigma}\cdot\bar{W}^{\mu}}{2} + i\dfrac{g'}{2}Y_{L}B^{\mu}\\
D_{R}^{\mu} &=\;\;  \partial^{\mu} + i\dfrac{g'}{2}Y_{R}B^{\mu}
\end{array} \right. ,\label{eq:lagLep} \\
&\left \{ \begin{array}{cl}
\mathcal{L}_{gauge}  &=\;\;  -\frac{1}{4}W_{\mu\nu}^{l}W^{\mu\nu\, l}  -\frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}\\
B_{\mu\nu} &=\;\;  \partial_{\mu}B_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}\\
W_{\mu\nu}^{l} &=\;\;  \partial_{\mu}W_{\nu}^{l} - \partial_{\nu}W_{\mu}^{l} - g\varepsilon^{jkl}W_{\mu}^{j}W_{\nu}^{k}
\end{array} \right. .\label{eq:lagGauge}
\end{align}
The gauge invariance is obtained through the definition of the
covariant derivatives $\slashed{D} = \gamma_{\mu}D^{\mu}$, 
which are different for the left- and
right-handed components of the field.
The chirality of the electroweak interactions does not find 
a theoretical motivation, but $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ transformations 
do make distinction between left and right helicity of the spinors.
Introducing the Weyl representation of the $\gamma$ matrices
\begin{equation}
\gamma^{0} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ \end{array}\right), \quad
\gamma^{i} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \sigma^{i} \\ -\sigma^{i} & 0 \\ \end{array}\right) \quad \textnormal{and} \quad
\gamma^{5} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{array}\right) \quad ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{i}$ are the Pauli matrices, the left- and right-handed spinors transform as:
\begin{align}
&\left \{ \begin{array}{ll}
\psi_{L} = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \gamma_{5})\phi &\rightarrow \; \psi_{L}' = e^{iY\beta(x) + i\bar{\sigma}\bar{\alpha}(x)}\psi_{L} \\
\psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \gamma_{5})\phi &\rightarrow \; \psi_{R}' = e^{iY\beta(x)}\psi_{R}
\end{array} \right. .
\label{eq:chiral}
\end{align}

Equation~\ref{eq:lagLep} is the ``free matter'' Lagrangian 
describing the transformation under the symmetry $SU(2)_{L}$ of weak isospin
with coupling constant $g$, three boson fields $W^{l}_{\mu\nu}$ and
their weak generators $\bar{\sigma}$\footnote{These are the Pauli matrices: 
$$
\sigma_{1} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ \end{array}\right), \quad
\sigma_{2} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \\ \end{array}\right), \quad
\sigma_{3} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\ \end{array}\right).
$$}, and under the symmetry
$U(1)_{Y}$ of hypercharge with coupling constant $g'/2$,
the boson field $B_{\mu\nu}$ and its hypercharge generator $Y$.
Equation~\ref{eq:lagGauge} is the Lagrangian for the vector bosons 
dynamics with self-couplings, including trilinear and quadrilinear terms. 



The Lagrangian \ref{eq:bareLagSM} is invariant under group 
$SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ transformation, but has the 
problem of leaving fermions massless. Thus a scalar 
Lagrangian with a quartic auto-interaction is introduced:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lagScalar}
\left \{ \begin{array}{cl}
\mathcal{L}_{\phi} &=\;\;  (D_{\phi}^{\mu} \phi)^{\dag}(D_{\phi\,\mu} \phi) - V(\phi^{\dag}\phi)\\
V &=\;\; \mu^{2}\phi^{\dag}\phi + \lambda(\phi^{\dag}\phi)^{2}\\
D_{\phi}^{\mu} &=\;\; \partial^{\mu} + ig\dfrac{\bar{\sigma}\cdot\bar{W}^{\mu}}{2} + i\dfrac{g'}{2}Y_{\phi}B^{\mu}
\end{array}\right. ,
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is an Higgs doublet, accounting for four 
degrees of freedom needed to give mass to three vector
bosons (the neutral $Z$ boson and the two $W^{\pm}$ bosons)
and to a scalar Higgs boson:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:higgsDoub}
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} \varphi^{+}\\\varphi^{0}
\end{pmatrix} =
\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{pmatrix} \varphi_{1}+i\varphi_{2}\\ \varphi_{3}+i\varphi_{4}\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

%Three terms, $\varphi^{+}$, $\varphi^{-}$ and $(\varphi^{0}-\bar\varphi^{0})/\sqrt{2}$, give mass to the three massive vector bosons $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$, leaving a massive Higgs scalar boson $(\varphi^{0}+\bar\varphi^{0})/\sqrt{2}$. 
The potential $V(\phi)$ depends on two parameters, $\mu^2$ and $\lambda$. 
The case $\lambda<0$ is unphysical, leading to no stable minima. For 
$\lambda>0$, two cases arise: $\mu^2>0$ and $\mu^2<0$. In the first case
(see Figure~\ref{fig:higgs1}) there is a single solution to the minimization
which corresponds to $|\phi|=0$ and gives as vacuum expectation value
$\bra{0}\phi \ket{0} = 0$. In the second case (see Figure~\ref{fig:higgs2}) 
the potential has a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value 
$\bra{0}\phi \ket{0} = v$ and %the symmetry is spontaneously broken, the minimum not being unique anymore.
the minimum is not unique anymore. The fundamental vacuum 
state is no more invariant under $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$, 
meaning that these two symmetries are now 
broken\footnote{Instead, the symmetry $U(1)_{elm} \subset SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ 
is not broken. This means that vacuum is electrically uncharged while 
it has isospin and hypercharge charges.}: 
this is the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) mechanism. 
The vacuum state is chosen as:

\end{center}\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:vacuum}
\phi_{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v/\sqrt{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $v = \sqrt{-\mu^{2}/\lambda}$ is 
the vacuum expectation value. Finally, since
only the vector bosons got their mass up to now,
the only thing left to do is to introduce 
the scalar-fermion interaction in order to give
mass to the fermions. This is done defining:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lagYukawa}
\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} = -G_{lept}\big[\bar\psi_{R}(\phi^{\dag}\psi_{L}) + (\bar\psi_{L}\phi)\psi_{R}\big] .
\end{equation}Thus the complete electroweak Lagrangian of the SM, that can be generalized also to quarks (see Table \ref{tab:isospin}), is\begin{equation}\label{eq:lagSM}
\mathcal{L}= \mathcal{L}_{lept} +\mathcal{L}_{gauge} +\mathcal{L}_{\phi} +\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa}.

An important consequence of the introduction of the scalar Higgs 
field and the consequent spontaneous symmetry breaking
is the mixing of the vector bosons $B_{\mu}$ and $W^{1,2,3}_{\mu}$ 
to give the photon $A_{\mu}$, the two $W^{\pm}_{\mu}$ and 
the $Z_{\mu}$ bosons:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:AZ}

\subsubsection{Adding the strong interaction}\label{sec:qcdlagr}

Adding the color transformations $SU(3)_{C}$, the Standard Model is
finally described by the symmetry group 
$SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\otimes SU(3)_{C}$.
In the same way electromagnetic interactions are 
described by Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED), 
strong interactions are described by Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD~\cite{Ecker}).
However, while the photon does not carry electric charge,
the gluon does carry color charge (in particular it exists in
eight states, being a color octet) and can, therefore, self-interact.

The QCD lagrangian only involves quarks and gluons, and reads:
\begin{equation}
\left \{ \begin{array}{cl}
\mathcal{L}_{QCD} &=\;\; \sum\limits_{f=1}^{6}\bar{q}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m_q)q 
                    -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}_{a}F^{a}_{\mu\nu}\\
 D_\mu &=\;\; \partial_\mu + ig_sG_\mu^a T^a\\
  F^{a}_{\mu\nu} &=\;\;  \partial_\mu G_\nu^a - \partial_\nu G_\mu^a - 
                    gf^{a}_{\ bc}G^b_\mu G^c_\nu
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the quark field and $m_q$ is the quark mass, summed over 
the six types of quarks, and $a$ runs over the eight degrees of 
freedom of the gluon field, $T^a$ being the generators
of the $SU(3)_C$ group. The field tensor $F^{a}_{\mu\nu}$ 
is derived from the gluon field $G_\mu^a$ and 
its third term describes the gluon self-interaction, with
$f^a_{\ bc}$ being the structure constants. 
%non-abelian nature  of the QCD, and it describes the
The strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ is defined
as  $\alpha_s=g/4\pi$ and its values, large at
low energies (i.e. large distances), and small at high 
energies (i.e. short distances), determine the 
peculiar property called {\it asymptotic freedom} which
explains the confinement of the quarks inside the hadrons
(see Figure~\ref{fig:alpha_s}). Indeed, at
small distances $\alpha_s$ is so low that
the strong interaction can be treated perturbatively
and quarks and gluons described as free particles.
On the other hand, a quark cannot be found
isolated since at large distances the field strength
will increase enough to create new quarks 
from the vacuum and colorless hadrons will be formed.

As an example of how quarks behave in hadrons,
protons are composed of two {\it valence} up quarks
and one {\it valence} down quark. The quarks continuosly
exchange gluons, which create in turn quark-antiquark pairs,
resulting in what is referred to as a ``sea'' 
of quarks and gluons. 
%randomly created and annihilated in vacuum fluctuations. 
As the sum of the rest masses of the valence quarks contributes 
only to about 1\% of the total nucleon
mass, what accounts for the missing 99\% is the
binding energy of gluons and sea quarks.
Further details on QCD will be given in Section~\ref{sec:MCphenomenology},
where the phenomenology of proton-proton collision
is discussed.
