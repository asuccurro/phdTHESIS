The Standard Model of particle physics is a
successful, mathematically-elegant and precise 
theory describing the interactions
between fundamental particles. 
Over the last few decades it has been verified experimentally
up to a very high degree of accuracy, most notably by precision measurements 
%Its validity has been tested by precision measurements 
at the Large Electron-Positron Collider at CERN.
The Standard Model has been further confirmed 
by the observation of all the particles it 
predicts, including the Higgs-like boson discovered at the
Large Hadron Collider in July of 2012 which up to now 
behaves as expected from the Standard Model.

However, unstabilities appear at high energy scales 
of the order of the Planck mass in the mathematical formulation.
This makes the Standard Model more like an {\it effective theory}, 
valid up to a certain energy scale, than a complete and final framework.
In this chapter we will first overview in Section~\ref{sec:THsm} the milestones
in the history of particle physics that lead to the construction
of the Standard Model, presented in Section~\ref{sec:THlagr}.
Section~\ref{sec:THquest} is dedicated to the
open questions that hint at the Standard Model 
as an effective theory and whose solutions are proposed
in the ``New Physics'' models like the ones described.
Some of them predict the presence of new heavy and exotic
quarks, namely {\it vector-like quarks}, which are
the objects hunted by the analyses presented in this dissertation.
A brief description of their properties and phenomenology is
given in Section~\ref{sec:THvlq}.
