Comparing fit results with direct measurements
of the free parameters of the SM, with the fit performed
with and without inclusion of the measured $M_H$. 
The pull values are defined as deviations between experimental 
measurements and theoretical calculations in units of the experimental uncertainty~\cite{Baak:2012kk}.
