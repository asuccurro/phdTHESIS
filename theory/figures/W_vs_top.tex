Contours of 68\% and 95\% confidence level obtained 
from scans of fits with fixed variable pairs 
$M_W$ vs. $m_t$. The narrower blue and larger 
grey allowed regions are the results of the 
fit including and excluding the $M_H$ measurements, 
respectively. The horizontal bands indicate the 1$\sigma$
regions of the $M_W$ and $m_t$ measurements (world averages)~\cite{Baak:2012kk}.
