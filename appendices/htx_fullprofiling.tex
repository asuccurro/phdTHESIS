\chapter{\htx\ analysis: background prediction using full profiling}
\label{app:fullprofiling}

In Section~\ref{sec:fullprof} the impact of a full
profiling of the \htx\ analysis was studied,
performing a fit to data considering all nuisance parameters 
(a total of 38) describing the fundamental
sources of uncertainty in the analysis, discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:htxSYS}. This approach allows 
to correct for potential mismodelings in the 
background-dominated channels \chii\ and \chiii,
corrections that can be ported in the \chiv\ channel,
the most signal-rich, in a physically significant way.

\caption{\label{tab:fit_null}
Fitted nuisance parameters to data under the background-only hypothesis. 
For each nuisance parameter the central value represents the
best-fit value in units of $\sigma$ of its a-priori uncertainty, 
whereas the quoted uncertainty indicates by how much is the a-priori uncertainty
reduced, also in units of $\sigma$. For example, a nuisance parameter 
measured at the nominal value and not constrained at all by the data would
be $0\pm 1$.}

Table~\ref{tab:fit_null} shows the fitted nuisance 
parameters (under the background-only hypothesis) 
for all considered systematic uncertainties. 
Most nuisance parameters are well within
$1\sigma$ of their a-priori value (zero) and almost 
not constrained with respect to their a-priori error (one). 


Table~\ref{tab:Yields_SignalRegion_FullProfiling} 
(~\ref{tab:Yields_SignalRegion_twoparameter})
show the final predicted yields for backgrounds
after full profiling of systematic uncertainties
(after the two-parameter fit).
These yields are in agreement within $\sim 10\%$,
and the improvement in the background prediction
in the \chiv\ channel is evident.
