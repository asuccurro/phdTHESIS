\chapter{\htx\ analysis: data to background comparison in control regions}\label{app:htxcontrol}

In this appendix the results from the comparison between data and
Standard Model backgrounds are outlined, in the electron 
(Section~\ref{app:DataMCControlELE}), muon (Section~\ref{app:DataMCControlMUON}), 
and combined channel (Section~\ref{app:DataMCControlELEMUON}).
The selections applied investigate for different jet multiplicities
(4, 5 and at least 6 jets) different \btag ged jet multiplicities
(0, 1, 2, 3 and at least 4 \btag ged jets). Each region is blinded
to possible signal contribution by means of a cut on the \HT\
variable (\HT\ being defined as the sum of the lepton \pt, the
\met\ and the \pt\ of all the jets selected in the event),
namely $\HT<700~\gev$.
In each of these sections, tables summarizing the
expected and observed yields in the various selections
are presented, followed by plots of the distributions
for data and Standard Model backgrounds of selected variables.

An additional set of control regions
is then presented in Section~\ref{app:htx_httail},
were a study was performed in order to identify
a suitable selection to investigate the final
discriminant variable $\HT$ in signal depleted
regions.
