\chapter{Search for \TTbar\ decaying to $Wb+X$}\label{chap:wbx}

%After an overview of the general features
%common to the two searches for vector-like top partner pairs
%in the single-lepton channel that are the object of this dissertation,
We present in this chapter the search for \TTbar\ production with
at least one heavy quark decaying into a $W$ boson and a bottom
quark, referred to as the \wbx\ analysis.
This search is particularly optimized for the $T\to Wb$ channel
and updates an analysis performed with the data collected
by ATLAS in 2011 of pp collisions at a \cme\ of \rts=7~\tev~\cite{ATLAS:2012qe},
whose main features and results are reported in Appendix~\ref{app:wbx7tev}.
The strategy followed is to reconstruct the $W$ boson decaying
into two light jets exploiting the different kinematic characteristics
of $W$ bosons from a heavy object like the vector-like top partner
and the lighter Standard Model (SM) top quark (see Section~\ref{sec:wbxSTRAT}).
The reconstruction of the $W$ bosons is illustrated in
Section~\ref{sec:boostedW}.
Section~\ref{sec:wbxEVT} describes the requirements to select the
final signal region and, as will be explained, two signal regions are identified, 
referred to as ``\loose'' and ``\tight'', respectively.
In Section~\ref{sec:wbxCR} we define ``control regions'' depleted of
signal that gradually approach the final signal region in order to 
verify the modeling of real data by the various expected
backgrounds contributions. 
The final discriminant chosen to search for the signal is
the heavy quark reconstructed mass, defined in Section~\ref{sec:wbxDISCR}.
Section~\ref{sec:wbxSYS} summarizes the analysis-specific 
systematic uncertainties considered in this search, which are in addition to
those described in Section~\ref{sec:systematics}.
Section~\ref{sec:wbxRES} is devoted to the results
and an outlook on possible future developments for this search is given
in Section~\ref{sec:wbxOUT}.
%Chapter~\ref{chap:results} is devoted to the results.

\section{Analysis strategy}\label{sec:wbxSTRAT}

The very high \cme\ available in the pp collisions provided by the LHC
can either be used by Nature to produce massive particles like the heavy 
quarks we are looking for or to produce lighter particles with high momentum.
In the case of \ttbar\ production, the main and irreducible background
of this search as both particles decay to a $W$ boson and a bottom quark,
the top quarks will receive a boost which is transferred to their decay
products. This means that the $W$ boson and the bottom quark from a Standard
Model top quark will be produced close-by along the direction of the parent
top quark. On the contrary, heavy top-like quarks will be produced almost
at rest, as most of the \cme\ goes into their mass, and their
decay products will be produced ``almost'' back-to-back. In this case,
both the $W$ boson and the bottom quark have the typical high
momentum of the decay products of heavy particles, 
resulting in a high-$p_T$ \bjet\ and close-by light jets (lepton and \met)
from the $W$ boson decay in the hadronic (leptonic) channel. This
difference, represented in the drawing of Figure~\ref{fig:boostedkin},
is at the heart of the \wbx\ search strategy.

\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}

	\caption{Pictorial representation of the typical kinematic configuration
        for top pairs decays (left), where the boosted objects are the top
        quarks themselves, and vector-like top pairs decays (right), where the
        boosted objects are the $W$ bosons.\label{fig:boostedkin}}
\end{center}\end{figure}

The strategy is therefore defined as follows:
the two $W$ bosons, one decaying leptonically and
one decaying hadronically, are reconstructed
as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:boostedW};
cuts based on the hardness of the event, as well
as on the angular separation of the objects, are
defined in order to achieve a high $S/B$ ratio;
the heavy quark mass is reconstructed and used
for the statistical analysis.

\section{$W$ boson reconstruction}\label{sec:boostedW}

In order to exploit the difference between the kinematics
of signal and background, the angular separation of the final state
objects is considered. Since the $W$ boson decay
in the lepton channel cannot be fully reconstructed because of
the presence of a neutrino, the analysis
focuses on the reconstruction of the $W$ boson that decays in the hadronic
channel (\whad).
The two jets from the decay of the \whad\ are expected to be
light-flavored jets. At the preselection level at least
one \btag ged jet is required. Since two \btag ged jets are expected in
the final state, and in order to avoid the loss in acceptance that would follow a strict
cut like requiring at least two \btag ged jets\footnote{Considering our choice
of the working point for the \btag ging \texttt{MV1} algorithm with a 70\%
efficiency, a selection requiring at least two \btag ged jets would result
in a 50\% selection efficiency.}, the two jets with the 
highest weight computed from the \btag ging algorithm are considered ``\bjet s''.
Amongst the light jets two cases are considered: either the two light flavoured
quarks were produced so close-by that after hadronization the jet reconstruction
algorithm identifies a single jet, or two nearby, distinct jets are reconstructed.
To account for the first category of events, jets with $\pt>250\gev$ and a mass
between 60~\gev\ and 120~\gev, an interval chosen to cover both the world-average 
$W$ and $Z$ boson masses values of $m_W = 80.4$~\gev\ and $m_Z = 91.2$~\gev\ and
hence increasing the acceptance for $T\to Zt$ events, are 
classified as \wi\ candidates. If no \wi\ candidates are found, jets are paired
in di-jet systems if their angular separation $\dr(j,j)$ is lower than 0.8 and, if
$p_T(jj)>200\gev$ and 
their invariant mass $m_{jj}$ lies in the same window as for the \wi\ candidates, they 
are taken as a \wii\ candidate.
If multiple candidates are found, the one with mass closest 
to the nominal $W$ boson mass is chosen as the hadronic $W$ boson
of the event. 
Figures~\ref{fig:mwhadI} and~\ref{fig:mwhadII} show the mass distribution
of the \wi\ and \wii\ candidates before the mass window cut is applied. The
number of \whad\ candidates after preselection is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:nWhad}. 

For what concerns the $W$ boson decaying in the leptonically (\wlep),
it is reconstructed using the lepton and the $\met$, 
which is considered as the transverse momentum of the neutrino. 
In order to define the neutrino longitudinal momentum, it is required that
the invariant mass of the two-body system composed by the lepton and the neutrino 
equals the nominal $W$ boson. 
%up to a two-fold ambiguity. 
The neutrino 4-momentum is therefore set using the $\met$ $X$ and $Y$ components
while the $Z$ component $p_{Z_\nu}$ is computed from: 
\begin{eqnarray}
P_W^2 = (P_l + P_{\nu})^2 = M_W^2,
\end{eqnarray}
resulting in two possible solutions for the 
$Z$ component of the neutrino momentum:
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{Z_\nu} = \frac{\lambda \pm \sqrt{\delta} }{2},
\end{eqnarray}
with:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda &=& 2\beta \dfrac{p_{Z_l}}{E_l^2-p_{Z_l}^2};\\
\delta  &=& \lambda^2 - 4\gamma;\\
\gamma &=& -\dfrac{\beta^2 - E_l^2 (p_{X_\nu}^2+p_{Y_\nu}^2)}{E_l^2-p_{Z_l}^2}; \\
\beta  &=& \alpha + p_{X_\nu}p_{X_l} + p_{Y_\nu}p_{Y_l}; \\
\alpha &=& \dfrac{1}{2}(M_W^2 - M_l^2).
\end{eqnarray}
The chosen solution is the one giving
%Trying to assign both $p_Z$ to the neutrino 4-momentum, we choose the solution for
the smallest difference between the reconstructed 
heavy quark mass for the
leptonic and hadronic side of the decays (see Section~\ref{sec:wbxDISCR} 
for the details on the invariant mass reconstruction).
In the case no real solution exists, the neutrino pseudorapidity 
is set equal to that of the lepton, since in the kinematic regime of interest  
the decay products of the $W$ boson tend to be collinear.


\section{Event selection}\label{sec:wbxEVT}

After preselection, as was explained in Section~\ref{sec:presel},
events with $\geq$6 jets and $\geq$3 \btag ged jets are rejected in order to
keep the \wbx\ and the \htx\ analyses orthogonal.
%Once $W$ bosons are reconstructed in the event like explained in 
%Section~\ref{sec:boostedW}, if at least one candidate is found the 
%event is kept and further selection cuts are applied.
Once all the objects taking part to the event are identified,
the selections summarized in Table~\ref{tab:wbxselection} are
applied with the aim of rejecting as much SM background
as possible. As can be seen in the table, two final selections referred to as
\loose\ and \tight\ are defined, the latter being a
subset of the former with two very restrictive cuts applied on top of it.
The ``Signal Region'' (SR) label is applied to the selections
progressively reaching the \tight\ selection.

\begin{table}[tb]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of event selection requirements.}
\label{tab:wbxselection}
\end{center}
\end{table}


After reconstructing at least one \whad\ candidate (SR1), a variable called $\htfj$ is defined
as the scalar sum of the lepton $\pt$, $\met$ and the $\pt$
of the four  highest-$\pt$ jets. This $\htfj$ distribution peaks at 
$\sim 2 m_{\T}$ for signal events and is therefore very useful to
discriminate between the signal and the background, as clearly shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:HTAll}. A cut at $\htfj>800\gev$ (SR2) is chosen as particularly
efficient in rejecting background while keeping most signal events.
Considering then the boost inflicted to the bottom quarks from the heavy
vector-like top decay, cuts on the \btag ged jets are defined.
Figures~\ref{fig:pTb1} and~\ref{fig:pTb2} show the transverse momentum distributions
of the highest-$\pt$ $b$-jet candidate ($b_1$) and 
the next-to-highest-$\pt$ $b$-jet candidate ($b_2$).
The cuts chosen are $\pt(b_1) > 160\gev$ (SR3) and $\pt(b_2) >80\gev$ (SR4).
To further discriminate between signal and background,
the angular separation between the lepton and the reconstructed neutrino 
(shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DRlnu}) is
required to satisfy $\Delta R(\ell,\nu)<1.2$, thus defining the 
\loose\ selection (SR5). In the \tight\ selection
two further cuts on the minimum angular separation between the lepton and a \btag ged, 
$\min(\Delta R(\ell, b_{1,2}))$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:DRlb}), 
and the minimum angular separation between the
\whad\ candidate and a \btag ged jet,
$\min(\Delta R(W_{\rm had}, b_{1,2}))$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:DRWb}) are defined as
 $\min(\Delta R(\ell, b_{1,2}))>1.4$ (SR6) and 
$\min(\Delta R(W_{\rm had}, b_{1,2}))>1.4$ (SR7, i.e. \tight\ selection).
In Table~\ref{tab:cftab} the expected and observed yields in these SRs are
reported for the electron and muon channels combined. In Appendix~\ref{app:wbxSR}
yield tables are provided for the  electron and muon channels separately.

In Table~\ref{tab:yields} the background estimates 
for the \loose\ and \tight\ selections are presented
together with the total predicted and observed yields
and the expectated number of events for two signal models, the
chiral and the singlet scenarios. 
The quoted uncertainties include both statistical and systematic contributions,
which are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:wbxSYS}.
The yields predicted from the SM and the observed yields 
are in agreement within these uncertainties.
The absence of QCD multijet background from the table is due
to the fact that after the $\htfj>800\gev$ requirement, the estimate
from the Matrix Method gives negative results, consistent with zero,
and is therefore set to zero.
It has been checked that its contribution is small ($\sim 0.2\%$ of the total)
even withouth the $\htfj$ requirement, and is therefore considered negligible.
Since in the final selection the SM background contributions
from $W$+jets, $Z$+jets, diboson, single-top, $\ttbar V$ and multi-jet events
are very small, it is chosen to show these backgrounds combined into a
single component called ``non-$t\bar{t}$''.
In addition, in order to increase the available statistics for these
non-$t\bar{t}$ backgrounds, instead of a direct cut on the \btag ging algorithm
weight to select at least one heavy flavor jet, the Tag Rate Function method
is used for the non-$t\bar{t}$ samples only. The method is detailed in 
Appendix~\ref{app:trf}, together with a study to validate the consistency
of this choice.

\section{Control regions}\label{sec:wbxCR}

In order to check the good modeling of SM background
and its agreement with data a number of ``signal-depleted'' regions (SDR) 
have been studied. These regions, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:SDRs},
progressively go from the preselection to the final selections 
rejecting the signal by means of reverting one of the \tight\ selection criteria.
This allows to test regions close enough to the final signal selections
but still suppressing a potential signal contribution.
Comparisons between data and background for 
selected kinematic variables in SDR4 and SDR5
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sdr4} and Figure~\ref{fig:sdr5} respectively.
Additional plots for each of these SDRs can be found in 
Appendix~\ref{app:wbxSDRs}.
In general, a reasonable agreement is found between data and SM
prediction, with the $t\bar{t}$ contribution being modeled by the Monte Carlo 
generator \texttt{MC@NLO}, which was chosen after comparison with other
generators as providing the best description in the event configurations
this analysis is mostly interested in.
A comparison between data and background prediction using three different 
$t\bar{t}$ Monte Carlo generators (\texttt{MC@NLO}, \texttt{POWHEG/PYTHIA} 
and \texttt{ALPGEN/HERWIG}), can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:wbxGENMOD} 
for some of the previously defined signal-depleted regions. %Overall MC@NLO provides the best description, which is the reason why it was adopted for default MC in this analysis. MC@NLO was also used in the previous result~\cite{atlas_WbWb_5fb_ljets}.

\section{Final discriminant: heavy quark reconstructed mass}\label{sec:wbxDISCR}

The discriminant variable chosen to build the binned log-likelihood ratio
for the statistical analysis is the reconstructed mass of the
heavy vector-like top partner quark that decays into the boosted \whad, 
referred to as $m_{\rm reco}$. In order to build this variable the \whad\ 
candidate reconstructed as described in Section~\ref{sec:boostedW} has to
be paired with the associated bottom quark, to be chosen from the two
\btag ged jets selected in the analysis.
Another source of ambiguity comes from the computation of the longitudinal
momentum of the neutrino from the $W$ boson decay in the lepton channel.
The various combinations for the leptonic solution and the \btag ged jets
pairing are attempted and the one that in the end returns
the smallest difference between $m_{\rm reco}$ and $m(\wlep,b)$ is chosen
as final configuration. Figure~\ref{fig:masses} shows the \mreco\ distributions
for chiral fourth-generation heavy top-partners with masses of 400~\gev,
600~\gev and 800~\gev. The distributions peak close to the generated 
heavy quark mass. It can also be seen from the small difference
between the \mreco\ distribution in the \loose\ (Figure~\ref{fig:massesLoose})
and \tight\ (Figure~\ref{fig:massesTight}) channels that the mass reconstruction
is almost not affected by the two additional cuts of the \tight\ selection.

The evolution of the signal peak in the \mreco\ distribution
in the first four steps of the signal region selection
(see Table~\ref{tab:wbxselection} for the definition of the
requirements) can be appreciated in Figure~\ref{fig:mrecofewSRs}.
In Figure~\ref{fig:mreco} the \mreco\ distribution in the \loose\
and \tight\ final selections is shown. From Figure~\ref{fig:mrecoLOOSE}
it is clear that this variable works well in discriminating between the
signal from the heavy quark and the backgrounds, with
an evident low \mreco\ sideband dominated by the
\ttbar\ background contribution. This allows a useful
check of the background modeling and, in case this channel
were to be used for the statistical analysis, the sideband would
help constraining the fluctuations.
Figure~\ref{fig:mrecoTIGHT}
instead shows a nice and clear peak from a chiral heavy top partner with mass
of 600~\gev\ with almost no background left after the \tight\ selection
requirements have been imposed.
In Appendix~\ref{app:wbxSR}
the final discriminant variable %(to be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:wbxDISCR})
is shown for data, background and signal in the selection steps 
through the signal region of Table~\ref{tab:wbxselection}.
As explained in Appendix~\ref{app:wbx_statanalyses}, 
studies performed in the 7~\tev\ $\TTbar\to WbWb$ analysis
found that the \tight\ selection
has the best sensitivity. Since we do not expect 
a different outcome for the 8~\tev\ \wbx\ analysis, the distribution of 
Figure~\ref{fig:mrecoTIGHT}, corresponding to the \tight\ selection, 
is the one chosen to derive the final result.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}\label{sec:wbxSYS}

%\subsection{Technical Details}
The general aspects of the systematic uncertainties considered
in the \wbx\ and \htx\ analyses were discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:systematics}. Here the features specific to the
\wbx\ analysis will be described.

\subsection{Merging of non-$t\bar{t}$ backgrounds}

The very stringent cuts defined to select signal and reject
background work so well that very low statistics is left for
``non-$t\bar{t}$'' backgrounds ($W+$jets, $Z+$jets, dibosons, single top, 
$t\bar{t}V$)\footnote{The prediction for QCD multi-jet background contribution
is negative and consistent with zero and is then set to zero.}.
This can lead to problems with the treatment of some systematic uncertainties as
e.g. an empty bin in the nominal case might have non-zero content in the
systematically varied sample. For this reason, considering that no resonances
are expected for these backgrounds, these \nontt\ samples are merged into
a single component. Systematic uncertainties like cross-section normalization,
which are specific for each background, are applied to the single component
and the nominal version of the other samples are added to obtain
a varied histogram.
For the \nontt\ background all systematic uncertainties are
treated as normalization-only.

%Contrary to what was described in Table~\ref{tab:sys}, all systematics are considered as normalization only for this small-background component. For the {\sc Tight} selection, we take the values derived from the {\sc Loose} selection, as we do not expect significant difference between the two cases.

\subsection{Jet energy scale}\label{sec:wbx_syst_jes}
Concerning the analysis performed in the \tight\ channel,
we recall here (see Section~\ref{sec:syst_jes} for details)
that it was chosen to treat the systematic uncertainties from
jet energy scale as a single component. Even with this treatment
large unphysical bin-to-bin fluctuations are observed
in the $m_{\rm reco}$ distribution for both $t\bar{t}$ and non-$t\bar{t}$
backgrounds in the \tight\ selection when the varied distributions
are compared with the nominal one. In order to overcome this issue
and the related noise that it would inject in the analysis, two different
approaches are followed for the $t\bar{t}$ and the non-$t\bar{t}$ background:
for the former, the systematic uncertainty shape is taken from the smoother
(because of the higher statistical population) template of the \loose\
channel, while in the case of the latter, where no resonances are expected,
a flat distribution is assumed and the systematic variation is taken as
normalization-only.
%Appendix~\ref{app:JEScomp} documents a study on the impact of each of the JES nuisance parameters on the normalisation and shape of the 
%reconstructed Higgs boson mass and $H_{Thad}$ distributions for $t\bar{t}H$ signal and $t\bar{t}$+jets background background in different
%jet multiplicity bins used in the analysis.
%Such study has resulted in a simplified prescription for the JES uncertainty breakdown for this analysis than involves a total
%of 9 nuisance parameters. 

\subsection{Jet energy resolution}
In addition to the general treatment explained in Section~\ref{sec:syst_jer},
%%%JER
for the $t\bar{t}$ and non-$t\bar{t}$ backgrounds 
the same behaviour is observed in the \tight\ channel
as for the systematic variations from the jet energy scale uncertainties.
Therefore the same treatment as previously outlined in 
Section~\ref{sec:wbx_syst_jes} is applied in order to 
reduce the impact on the analysis from
large unphysical statistical fluctuations.

\subsection{Jet mass scale and resolution}
The jet mass variable is used to identify the most 
energetic \wi\ candidate.
Following previous studies carried out in 
the context of the 7~\tev\ $\TTbar\to WbWb$
analysis~\cite{ATLAS:2012qe}, 
%(briefly summarized in Appendix~\ref{app:wbx7tev}),
the jet mass scale uncertainties were estimated to be
4.5\% for jets with $\pt<400\gev$ and 6\% for $\pt>400\gev$.
The propagation of these uncertainties in the 7~\tev\ $\TTbar\to WbWb$
analysis led to a degradation in the expected 
sensitivity of only a few $\gev$ 
and was judged to be a 
conservative uncertainty at the time. 
%and since no recommendation for  $R=0.4$ jets currently exists,  
Therefore this systematic uncertainty is currently neglected.


\subsection{\Wboson/\Zboson+jets normalisation}
\label{sec:syst_vjetsnormWBX}
The $W$/$Z$+jets cross sections as computed at the
leading-order in the
\texttt{ALPGEN} generator framework
are affected by large uncertainties.
It was explained in Section~\ref{sec:Wjetsnorm}
that the overall $W$+jets normalization is 
corrected using data-driven methods 
performing the estimation in each jet multiplicity
bin (in the case of the \wbx\ analysis, the 4 jet bin
and the $\geq 5$ jet bin) in order to get the best
possible evaluation for the $W$+jets background contribution.
Additional uncertainties come from the fractions of $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$ and $Wc$
events and from their extrapolation from 2-jet events to higher jet multiplicity. 
The total uncertainty on the estimated $W$+jets normalization
in the \tight\ channel, as obtained from the  sum in quadrature 
of the above contributions, is of $\sim$30\%.



\subsection{$t\bar{t}$ modelling}
\label{sec:systematic_ttbarmodel}

In order to evaluate the effect of systematic uncertainties 
affecting the modelling of the $t\bar{t}$ background from the
\texttt{MC@NLO} generator, the following factors are considered
in the \wbx\ analysis: the choice of NLO event generator;
the modeling of initial and final state radiation from QCD
precesses; the choice of parton shower and fragmentation models.
The limited available Monte Carlo statistics in 
the \tight\ selection result in 
large bin-to-bin fluctuations and unphysical shape systematics.
In order to try to get smoother uncertainties 
the acceptance change is estimated by comparing 
the alternative \ttbar\ Monte Carlo samples.
Templates are then normalized to unity and the
ratio is computed to derive the variation in shape
and then fitted to a low-order polynomial.
If the ration is flat, like in the case of
the NLO generator systematic, the systematic uncertainty
is taken as normalization only, while 
for ISR/FSR and fragmentation systematics,
the fit returns a  first-order polynomial, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ttbarmodel_ratios}.
Finally the nominal template is multiplied by 
each of the parameterizations obtained and 
its yield is normalized with the relative 
acceptance changes found in the first step.
%The resulting shape systematics can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:TOPMODEL}.


Concerning the NLO event generator choice, the effect of 
systematics uncertainties on the parton-level modeling of the
$t\bar{t}$ events is evaluated by comparing the distributions from two 
NLO Monte Carlo generators, namely \texttt{MC@NLO} (used for the nominal 
prediction in the \wbx\ 
analysis) and \texttt{POWHEG}, both interfaced to \texttt{HERWIG} for
parton showering.  This choice is based on comparisons
between data and Monte Carlo SM backgrounds in a number 
of signal-depleted control regions reported in Appendix~\ref{app:wbxGENMOD}. 
In these studies three different $t\bar{t}$ generators, \texttt{MC@NLO}, 
\texttt{POWHEG+PYTHIA} and
\texttt{ALPGEN+HERWIG} were compared. In general, it was found that 
data was bracketed by \texttt{MC@NLO} and \texttt{POWHEG+PYTHIA} predictions,
with \texttt{MC@NLO} providing the best description overall, which 
motivated its choice as the main $t\bar{t}$ generator for this analysis. 
In contrast, \texttt{ALPGEN+HERWIG} was found to be the most inconsistent 
model with data, predicting yields above \texttt{POWHEG+PYTHIA}, which 
motivated its rejection
as a valid alternate $t\bar{t}$  model in the kinematic region 
explored by this analysis.

Differences between \texttt{MC@NLO} and \texttt{POWHEG} arise from 
the details on how the NLO calculation is interfaced with the parton 
shower, resulting in \texttt{POWHEG} predicting higher
jet multiplicities than \texttt{MC@NLO}. The two samples used for the
comparison have been processed through a fast simulation of the detector,
and the difference in shape and normalization from these two samples of
\texttt{POWHEG}+\texttt{HERWIG} 
and \texttt{MC@NLO} is symmetrised and propagated to the 
\texttt{MC@NLO} fully simulated sample as systematic uncertainty. 
The resulting uncertainty on the $t\bar{t}$ yield in the \tight\ selection 
is 48\%, and is the higher contribution to the total uncertainty
on the $t\bar{t}$ background. The same uncertainty in the \loose\ selection 
is 16\%. The significant
increase in the uncertainty for the \tight\ selection 
is mainly due to the increase in jet multiplicity in the
sample simulated with \texttt{POWHEG} with respect to the
one simulated with \texttt{MC@NLO}, 
which leads to a larger rate of misreconstructed $W_{\rm had}$ 
candidates. This makes the final cut of 
$\min(\Delta R(W_{\rm had}, b_{1,2}))>1.4$ cut less 
effective in discriminating signal and background than in the 
case of the nominal \texttt{MC@NLO}.

To assess the systematic uncertainty on the modeling of 
initial state (ISR) and final state radiation (FSR), dedicated
$t\bar{t}$ samples are generated with \texttt{ACERMC}
combined with \texttt{PYTHIA}, using modified \texttt{PYTHIA} parameters 
%%%yes?no?
(PARP(67), PARP(64) and PARP(72)) 
in order to increase or reduce the amount of parton shower. 
The range of variation for these parameters is chosen to be 
consistent with existing measurements such as the gap fraction in dileptonic 
$t\bar{t}$ events~\cite{ttjet} and jet shapes in QCD multijet events~\cite{morelessPS}.  
These samples have been processed through a fast simulation
of the detector. Half the difference between these alternate samples is symmetrized 
and propagated to the \texttt{MC@NLO} fully-simulated sample, resulting in a
systematic uncertainty on the $t\bar{t}$ yield in the \tight\ channel of 8.8\%.

Finally, systematic uncertainties on the simulation 
of the parton shower and fragmentation models chosen 
are studied by comparison of two different hadronisation 
models applied to the same parton level generator: 
\texttt{POWHEG}+\texttt{HERWIG} vs \texttt{POWHEG}+\texttt{PYTHIA}, 
both samples being processed through a fast simulation of the detector.
The relative difference measured between 
\texttt{POWHEG}+\texttt{HERWIG} and \texttt{POWHEG}+\texttt{PYTHIA} is 
then symmetrised and propagated to the 
\texttt{MC@NLO} nominal sample, with a final
result of a systematic uncertainty on the 
$t\bar{t}$ yield in the \tight\ selection of 25\%.

All samples used are obtained with the fast detector simulation.
Also shown are fits to low-order polynomials in order to derive smooth shape systematics.
\label{fig:ttbarmodel_ratios}}
\end{center}\end{figure}


\subsection{$V$+jets modelling}

The effect of systematic uncertainties affecting the 
modeling of the $V$+jets bacground kinematics by the \texttt{ALPGEN}
generator is assessed by changing the factorization scale from the nominal
choice, $Q^2 =m_{\rm W}^2+\sum m_{\rm T}^2$, to $Q^2 =m_{\rm W}^2+p_{\rm T,W}^2$. 
The resulting variation is then symmetrized.
%The variations are implemented via a per-event weight computed as a function of leading jet $\pt$. For more information see Ref.~\cite{WjetsReweighting}.
%{\bf Caveat: currently only the iqopt3 uncertainty is being considered. The ptjmin10 uncertainty will be included in the next iteration.}



\subsection{Overall effect of systematic uncertainties}\label{sec:wbxALLSYS}

In Table~\ref{tab:wbxSystSummary} the final results on
the effect of the different systematic uncertainties affecting
the \wbx\ analysis are reported. It can be seen that the main
contributions come from jet energy scale and resolution,
\btag ging efficiency and, in the case of the \ttbar\ 
background, from the uncertainty on the Monte Carlo modeling
of the simulated \ttbar\ sample.

\section{Results}\label{sec:wbxRES}


In the \wbx\ analysis no significant excess of data over the 
expected background has been observed in the \mreco\ spectra 
of Figure~\ref{fig:mreco}.
The observed and expected upper limits on the \TTbar\ production cross section 
times branching fraction as a function of $m_{\T}$ are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:limits1D_wbx} for the two chosen benchmark scenarios,
namely the chiral model with 100\% BR($T\to Wb$) and the weak-isospin singlet 
model.
These results include both statistical and systematic uncertainties,
and the consistency of the data with the background prediction is 
assessed following the concepts presented in Section~\ref{sec:cls}
by computing the $p$-value under the background-only hypothesis
(1-$CL_{\rm b}$) for each point of the two-dimensional plane 
(each point corresponding to a signal scenario) and for every heavy 
quark mass point considered (one two-dimensional plane is built for each
$m_T$ value). The smallest $p$-value found is of 0.095 for a vector-like
top-partner with mass $m_{\T}=350\gev$, $BR(\T \to Zt)=0.9$ 
and $BR(\T \to Wb)=BR(\T \to Ht)=0.05$, which corresponds to a 
significance of 1.7 standard deviations above the 
background-only prediction, which is, therefore, not significant.
For a chiral fourth-generation $\T$ quark, an observed (expected) 95\%  CL  limit 
$m_{\T}>740\,(770)\gev$ is obtained for the central value of the 
theoretical cross section, pushing $\sim$100~\gev\ further the
limit set by the previous analysis using pp collisions
at the \cme\ of 7~\tev~\cite{ATLAS:2012qe}.
This result can also be applied to a $Y$ vector-like quark with electric charge of
$-4/3$ and decaying into a $W^-$ boson and a $b$ quark.
For a vector-like singlet $\T$ quark, an observed (expected) 95\%  CL  limit 
$m_{\T}>505\,(630)\gev$ is obtained for the central value of the 
theoretical cross section.

%To assess the impact of the systematic uncertainties on the limit,
%the result has been compared with what is obtained including in the
%analysis only the statistical errors and it was found that systematic
%uncertainties give a degradation of the expected cross section
%limit by $\sim$50\% for the higher $m_{\T}$ values used.

Concerning the quasi-model independent strategy illustrated in Section~\ref{sec:strategy}, 
we recall here that a the two-dimensional plane was defined in order
to perform a scan of the allowed branching ratios.
To probe the full plane the signal samples are reweighted by the ratio
of desired branching ratio to the original branching ratio generated
by \texttt{PROTOS} and the complete analysis are repeated in each point.
The  95\% CL exclusion limits  obtained in the scan of the two-dimensional
plane by varying the mixing of the three decay channel contributions for
different values of $m_{\T}$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:limits2D_wbx}. 
This plot reads as follow: taking for instance the $600\gev$ 
vector-like top partner, a heavy quark with
$BR(\T\to W b)>0.7$ is excluded at $\geq 95\%$ CL, 
regardless of the value of the vector-like quark branching ratios to $Ht$ and $Zt$.  
%All the decay modes contribute to the final sensitivity when setting limits.
%For example, assuming $m_{t^\prime}=600\gev$, 
%the acceptance times efficiency of the {\sl tight} selection is 2.45\%, 0.64\%, 0.47\%, 0.10\%, 0.18\% and 0.16\%, for 
%decays to $WbWb$, $WbZt$, $WbHt$, $ZtZt$, $ZtHt$ and $HtHt$, respectively.

\section{Outlook}\label{sec:wbxOUT}

It has been shown that the search channel, the \tight\ selection,
suffers from poor statistical population of Monte Carlo simulated
backgrounds, an issue that resulted in a degradation
of the final sensitivity. The problem can easily be overcome by
using larger Monte Carlo samples. Another possible improvement
might come from an optimization of the cut on the total transverse
momentum, the $\htfj$ variable, which peaks at about $\htfj\sim 2m_T$
and can therefore be tightened further for higher mass values of the
heavy quark. Finally, considering the expected increase in the
\cme\ of pp collision at the LHC, it might be worth considering 
jet definitions other than the \texttt{AKT4}, even as simple as
anti-$k_T$ jets with larger cones, and limit the boosted $W$
boson reconstruction to single jets. This last option, of course,
would need detailed studies, while the first two suggestions
can be implemented straight-forwardly.
