        The data (solid black points) are compared to the background 
        prediction from Standard Model (stacked histograms). 
        The total uncertainty on the background estimation (see Section~\ref{sec:SystematicUncertainties} for details) is shown as a black hashed band.
        The expected contribution from a chiral fourth-generation 
        $\T$ quark with mass $m_{\T}=600\gev$ is also shown (red shaded histogram), 
        stacked on top of the SM background. 
        The lower panel shows the ratio of data to SM prediction. 
        The overflow has been added to the last bin.
