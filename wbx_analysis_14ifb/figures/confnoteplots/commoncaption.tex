        The data (solid black points) are compared to the background 
        prediction from Standard Model (stacked histograms). 
        The total uncertainty on the background estimation (see 
        Section~\ref{sec:wbxSYS} for details) is shown as a black hashed band.
        The expected contribution from a chiral fourth-generation $T$ quark 
        with mass $m_{\T}=600\gev$, multiplied by a factor of 50, 
        is also shown (red dashed histogram).
        The lower panel shows the ratio of data to background prediction. 
        The overflow has been added to the last bin.
