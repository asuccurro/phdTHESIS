In addition, the following normalisation uncertainties are considered in
determining the systematic uncertainty on the estimate of the $W$+jets
heavy-flavour content:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fractions of $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$ and $Wc$ are varied by $\pm 20\%$ 
in a correlated way; the fraction of $W$+light jets is recomputed to
maintain the overall  $W$+jets normalisation before any $b$-tagging requirement;
\item  the fractions of $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$ are varied by $\pm 20\%$ 
in a correlated way, while the fraction of $W$+light jets is left untouched; the
fraction of $Wc$ is recomputed to maintain the overall  $W$+jets normalisation before any $b$-tagging requirement;
\item a theoretical systematic uncertainty on the $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$  and $Wc$ fractions
from the extrapolation made from 2-jet events, where these fractions are measured in data, 
to higher jet multiplicity is assessed. This uncertainty is estimated from simulation studies where
the $W$+heavy-flavour fractions are studied as a function of variations in the {\sc Alpgen} generator parameters.
For each jet multiplicity above 2 jets, a 25\% uncertainty
on these fractions is added in quadrature, resulting in a total uncertainty of 35\% for 4 jets, 43\% for 5 jets,
and 50\% for $\geq 6$ jets. 
These extrapolation uncertainties on $Wb\bar{b}$ and $Wc\bar{c}$ are
treated as fully correlated, and both are treated as uncorrelated with respect to
the extrapolation uncertainty on $Wc$.
The fraction of $W$+light jets is recomputed to
maintain the overall  $W$+jets normalisation  before any $b$-tagging requirement.
