\subsection{Comparison of signal prediction between singlet and doublet scenarios}
\label{sec:SingletvsDoublet}

As discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:SimulatedSamples}, the signal MC samples used in this analysis were
generated in the singlet scenario, for which the mixing between the $\T$ quark and SM quarks is left-handed.
For simplicity, these samples are reweighted to reproduce any desired branching-ratio configuration, included
that corresponding to a doublet scenario. There is a small concern that for the latter the mixing between the $\T$
quark and SM quarks is right-handed, slightly affecting the kinematics and thus the signal acceptance and shape
of the $\HT$ distribution. Two MC samples for the doublet scenario, corresponding to $m_{\T}=350$ and $600\gev$, are available, which
have been used to check this effect. Figure~\ref{fig:HT_checks_SingletvsDoubletComp} compares, for both mass
points and each of the three analysis channels considered, the yield and shape of the $\HT$ distribution for the 
predicted signal using the singlet and doublet samples. In both cases the samples were reweighted to reproduce
the branching ratios corresponding to the doublet model. As it can be appreciated, the shapes of the distributions
are in reasonable agreement and discrepancies in the yields are below 5\% in the highest-sensitivity channel ($\geq 4$ $b$ tags).

\section{Systematic uncertainties}\label{sec:htxSYS}

Most of the systematic uncertainties were discussed in~\ref{sec:systematics}
as common to the \wbx\ and \htx\ analyses. 


\begin{table}[h!tb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{1.\textwidth}{!}{
\input{htx_analysis_14ifb/tables/sys_4b}}
\caption{\label{tab:htxSYS4b} }

\end{table}

%%%%NB COPY PASTE
The overall systematic uncertainty before the two-parameter fit ({\it pre-fit})
on the background normalization in the $\geq 4$ $b$-tags channel is 
$\sim$42\%, with the dominant uncertainties being from $b$ tagging efficiency (16\%),
$c$ tagging efficiency (11\%), jet energy scale (11\%), $t\bar{t}$ modelling (11\%), 
$t\bar{t}$+heavy-flavour fractions (32\%) and $t\bar{t}$ cross section (10\%).

As a result of the two-parameter fit, the total background uncertainty is reduced 
by about 80\% in this channel. The total  systematic uncertainty
in the signal normalisation in the $\geq 4$ $b$-tags channel is 
$\sim$21\%, completely dominated by the uncertainty in the $b$ tagging efficiency.



%%JES
As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:SystSummary}, for the \htx\ analysis
the JES systematic uncertainty is split into 8
uncorrelated components, each with a different jet $\pt$ and $\eta$
dependence, which are treated independently.
The \texttt{JetUncertainties} tool~\cite{jesuncertaintyprovider} allows computation of
uncertainties corresponding to each of the 8 different eigenvectors.
By studying the individual sources of uncertainty, we found out the dominant
contribution comes from the first eigenvector (BASELINE JES). 
The rest of the
eigenvectors lead to very small uncertainties, except for low statistics MC samples,
where the migration of few events in/out of the sample can lead to artificially large
uncertainties. Given the limited MC statistics available for the leading backgrounds,
we are currently considering the JES envelope uncertainty (i.e. no JES breakdown)
in order to attempt to get a physical estimate of the uncertainty in the analysis.
We believe this actually provides a more accurate assessment of the JES uncertainty
in this analysis, although we are likely still double-counting statistical uncertainties from
the MC.




\subsection{Normalisations of Data-Driven Backgrounds}
\label{sec:syst_normHTX}
In this section the uncertainties in data-driven background estimates are described.

\subsubsection{\Wboson/\Zboson+jets Normalisation}
\label{sec:syst_vjetsnormHTX}
The \Wboson/\Zboson+jets cross sections from {\sc Alpgen} are affected by large uncertainties because they 
are a leading-order calculation. 
As discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:wjets_bkg}, the overall $W$+jets normalisation is obtained via data-driven methods 
separately for events with exactly 4 and $\geq 5$ jets in order to ensure the best possible central value for the 
predicted $W$+jets yield. An additional 24\% uncertainty is assigned to the extrapolation of the data-driven
estimate to events with $\geq 6$ jets.

In addition, the following normalisation uncertainties are considered in
determining the systematic uncertainty on the estimate of the $W$+jets
heavy-flavour content:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fractions of $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$ and $Wc$ are varied by $\pm 20\%$ 
in a correlated way; the fraction of $W$+light jets is recomputed to
maintain the overall  $W$+jets normalisation before any $b$-tagging requirement;
\item  the fractions of $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$ are varied by $\pm 20\%$ 
in a correlated way, while the fraction of $W$+light jets is left untouched; the
fraction of $Wc$ is recomputed to maintain the overall  $W$+jets normalisation before any $b$-tagging requirement;
\item a theoretical systematic uncertainty on the $Wb\bar{b}$, $Wc\bar{c}$  and $Wc$ fractions
from the extrapolation made from 2-jet events, where these fractions are measured in data, 
to higher jet multiplicity is assessed. This uncertainty is estimated from simulation studies where
the $W$+heavy-flavour fractions are studied as a function of variations in the {\sc Alpgen} generator parameters.
For each jet multiplicity above 2 jets, a 25\% uncertainty
on these fractions is added in quadrature, resulting in a total uncertainty of 35\% for 4 jets, 43\% for 5 jets,
and 50\% for $\geq 6$ jets. 
These extrapolation uncertainties on $Wb\bar{b}$ and $Wc\bar{c}$ are
treated as fully correlated, and both are treated as uncorrelated with respect to
the extrapolation uncertainty on $Wc$.
The fraction of $W$+light jets is recomputed to
maintain the overall  $W$+jets normalisation  before any $b$-tagging requirement.
\end{itemize}
%The first two uncertainties result from the propagation of the experimental uncertainties in the
%measurement of the heavy-flavour fractions in $W$+1 jet and $W$+2 jets data control samples.

The sum in quadrature of the above contributions result in a total uncertainty of $\sim$50\% on
the estimated $W$+jets normalisation for events with $\geq 6$ jets and $\geq 2$ $b$ tagged jets. 
This uncertainty is also assigned to the $Z$+jets normalisation.

\subsubsection{Multijet Normalisation}
\label{sec:qcd_normHTX}
Systematic uncertainties on the multijet background estimate via the Matrix Method receive
contributions from the limited data statistics, particularly at high jet and $b$-tag multiplicities, as
well as from the uncertainty on the method, based on the difference between estimates obtained using 
different control regions and from the calibration of the method using simulated multijet events.
The uncertainty due to the method is assessed to be 50\%, which is taken as correlated across jet
and $b$-tag multiplicity bins. 
%The statistical uncertainties in the channels with 4 jets
%are only a few percent and are therefore neglected.
%The statistical uncertainties in the channels with 5 jets and 6 jets 
% are in the range of 10\%--54\% and 
%14\%--66\%, respectively, depending on the $b$-tag multiplicity bin.
%These uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated across jet and $b$-tag multiplicity bins.




\subsubsection{$t\bar{t}$+jets Modelling}
\label{sec:syst_ttbarmodelHTX}

A number of systematic uncertainties affecting 
the modelling of $t\bar{t}$+jets are considered
in this analysis. Systematic uncertainties associated 
with the choice of factorisation and renormalisation 
scales in {\sc Alpgen} are considered. For the former, 
two different uncertainties are taken into account.


\ifIsINT
\paragraph{$\mathbf{Q_{fac}}$}: 
\fi
On the one hand, the factorisation scale for the hard scatter is varied by a factor of two up and down relative to the
original scale, $Q^2=\sum_{\rm partons} (m^2 + \pt^2)$.
\ifIsINT 
Appendix~\ref{app:AlpgenModellingAppendix} describes details of the
implementations of this uncertainty for the $t\bar{t}$+light partons and $t\bar{t}Q\bar{Q}$ ($Q=b,c$) samples, which are different.
\fi
Since sometimes both variations can go in the same direction, the largest of the two is taken and symmetrised.
\ifIsINT
\paragraph{Functional form of the factorisation scale (iqopt2):} 
\fi
On the other hand, the default choice for the dynamic factorisation scale,
$Q^2=\sum_{\rm partons} (m^2 + \pt^2)$,  is compared to an alternate choice, $Q^2=x_1 x_2 s$.
\ifIsINT
See Appendix~\ref{app:AlpgenModellingAppendix} for more details on the implementations of this uncertainty 
for the $t\bar{t}$+light jets and $t\bar{t}Q\bar{Q}$ ($Q=b,c$) samples, which are different).
\fi
This uncertainty is significantly larger than that obtained by simply scaling the factorization scale up and down by a factor two 
and is symmetrised to obtain a two-sided uncertainty.

\ifIsINT
\paragraph{$\mathbf{k_{Tfac}}$}: 
\fi
The renormalisation scale associated with the evaluation of $\alpha_s$ at each local
vertex in the matrix element calculation is varied by a factor of two
up and down relative to the original scale, $k_{\rm T}$, between two
partons.  
\ifIsINT 
Additional details are described in Appendix~\ref{app:AlpgenModellingAppendix}.
\fi 
This uncertainty is only applicable for the $t\bar{t}$+light partons
sample, since that is the only sample to which the MLM matching prescription~\cite{mlm} is
applied. As a result, this uncertainty cannot be applied to the events 
originating from the dedicated $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ and $t\bar{t}c\bar{c}$
simulated samples. However, this uncertainty is applied to the subset of $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ and $t\bar{t}c\bar{c}$
events selected from the $t\bar{t}$+light partons MC samples after the
heavy-flavour overlap removal procedure.

%\paragraph{Heavy-flavour overlap removal}:  The $\Delta R$ cut between $Q\bar{Q}$ pairs in $t\bar{t}Q\bar{Q}$ ($Q=b,c$)  used to decide
%whether to take the matrix element or parton shower predictions is varied by $\pm 0.1$ about the nominal value
%of $\Delta R=0.4$. {\em Caveat: this systematic uncertainty has not been incorporated in the analysis yet.}

\subsubsection{$t\bar{t}$+jets Heavy-Flavour Content}
\label{sec:syst_ttbarHF}
The fraction of $t\bar{t}Q\bar{Q}$ ($Q=b,c$) events relative to all $t\bar{t}jj$ events, where $j$ denotes any parton,
is one of the most important systematic uncertainties in this analysis. 
Currently there are no available theoretical predictions for the $t\bar{t}$+heavy-flavour fractions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\tev$ at NLO matched to a parton shower.
In order to estimate a systematic uncertainty, the dependence of the ratio of cross sections for $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ over
$t\bar{t}jj$ as a function of the factorisation scale choice is examined in {\sc Alpgen}. These cross
sections are computed requiring the extra partons to satisfy $\pt>20\gev$, $|\eta|<2.5$ and $\Delta R({\rm j},{\rm j})>0.4$, which are similar requirements
to those used in this analysis. The ratio of cross sections is computed for the default factorisation scale choice
in {\sc Alpgen}, $Q^2=\sum_{\rm partons} (m^2 + \pt^2)$, which is then scaled up and down by a factor of two
in a correlated way for $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ and $t\bar{t}jj$.
The variation in the ratio of cross sections is found to be $\leq 25\%$. A similar conclusion is reached if a
different dynamic scale,  $Q^2=x_1 x_2 s$, is chosen, and then scaled up and down by a factor of two.
The systematic uncertainty assigned to the $t\bar{t}$+heavy-flavour fraction is 50\%, conservatively doubling
the variation found in the generator-level study with {\sc Alpgen}. 

Therefore, the fraction of $t\bar{t}Q\bar{Q}$ ($Q=b,c$) events relative to all $t\bar{t}$+jets events
is varied up and down by $\pm 50\%$ (relative) with respect to the original {\sc Alpgen} prediction. 
This uncertainty is taken to be fully correlated between the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ and $t\bar{t}c\bar{c}$ fractions.
The fraction of $t\bar{t}$+light jet events is adjusted accordingly to preserve the total $t\bar{t}$ yield in each jet multiplicity bin 
prior to any $b$-tagging requirement.
