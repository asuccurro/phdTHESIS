\section{Underlying-event}\label{sec:underlyingevent}

Underlying events are the product of the hadronic character of p-p hard interaction, where the main collision process
is accompanied by secondary parton interactions at low transfered momentum (soft QCD) and are flavor- and color-connected to the
hard scattering. They are observed as jets of particles close to the direction of the beam and are in general not 
separable from the event of interest. Their contribution can be studied with Monte Carlo techniques tuned with data from 
\textit{minimum bias} events, as perturbative theory does not properly model low momentum QCD.
