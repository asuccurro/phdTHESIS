Observed (red filled area) and expected (red dashed line) 95\% CL exclusion in the plane of
$BR(\T \to Wb)$ versus $BR(\T \to Ht)$, for different values of the vector-like $\T$ quark mass.
The grey (dark shaded) area corresponds to the unphysical region where the sum of branching ratios exceeds unity. 
The default branching ratio values from the \texttt{PROTOS} event generator for the weak-isospin singlet and doublet cases 
are shown as plain circle and star symbols, respectively. This result includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties.
