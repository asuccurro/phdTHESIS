\chapter{Searches for vector-like top partner pairs in the single lepton channel}~\label{chap:vlq}

In the following Chapter we will describe two searches for vector-like 
top partners \TTbar\ pairs performed in the single lepton channel. These analyses
are optimized for different final states and are thus complementary.
The first search focuses on decay channels with high BR to $Wb$ and is 
performed using the full dataset of p-p collisions at the \cme of \rts=8~\tev\
collected during 2012 at the ATLAS detector, consinsting in 20.34~\ifb, while
the preliminary search for vector-like top partners with high BR to $Ht$
uses a partial dataset of the same data, amounting to 14.3~\ifb.

The Chapter is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:data} and Section~\ref{sec:MCbkg}
present respectively the data and Monte Carlo samples used in the searches, which
are in general common to both analyses with only few exceptions that are reported;
Section~\ref{sec:qcdbkg} describes how the multi-jet background from QCD events is
obtained; Section~\ref{sec:objects} contains a brief reminder of object definition.
Finally, the two analyses are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:wbx} and Section~\ref{sec:htx}, 
which illustrate the event selection criteria, the background modeling estimation, 
the systematics affecting the analysis, the statistical treatment and the
results.
